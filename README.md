## Why I Built This

Every time I tried to convert images to PDF online, it was the same story:
- File size or page count limits  
- Forced sign-ups  
- Premium tiers to unlock basic features  

So I built my own — a completely free, no-login tool that anyone use.  
It’s fast, private, and doesn’t track or store your files.
